hello this is a graph algorithm visualizer project 

you can access the latest online PC version(currently only PC version is available) at 
https://kridacreations.github.io/graph_algorithm_visualizer/

currently the algorithm it support are

1)depth first search
2)breadth first search

ot of other algorithms will also be added 

INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING NODES:-

1) to add a node choose the "add" button from the above panel and click on the workspace a node will be added.
2) to delete a node choose the delete button from above pane and click on the node ,the node will be deleted.
3) to connect two nodes choose the connect button, click on a node the node will be foccused, now click on other nodes to connect the foccused, to remove the foccus click on a empty place the current foccused node will be removed.
4)to delete a connection between two nodes,again repeat the process of connection, the node will be disconnected.
5)to move a node choose the move button, and now you can drag and drop the nodes to desired position. 

INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING WORKSPACE:-
1) press "W" or "UP" button to zoom in around the cursor position
2) press "S" or "DOWN" button to zoom out arounf the cursor position
3) click with middle button and drag to move the workspace.

INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING ANIMATIONS:-
1) choose a foccus node.
2) choose the desired algorithm 
3) click on "bake animation" button to prepare the animation.
4) now you can click the "play button" to watch the animation
5) when animation start playing the "abort animation button" will be active.
6) you can click on that button to abort the animation.
